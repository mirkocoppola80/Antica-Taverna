# Antica-Taverna
Website project for an italian restaurant.

This is a website made with Twitter Bootstrap where i put several issue as toggable tabs for the menu, responsive pages, google maps api.
The contact page is made in php just to manage required fields and email sending; the contact page, obviously, doesn't work due to php estension.
